# Polynomial Regression with Ridge and Lasso

This project demonstrates polynomial regression on the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn.  
The focus is on understanding how polynomial features affect model performance and how regularization (Ridge and Lasso) can help reduce overfitting.

## Project Overview
- Load the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn  
- Apply polynomial feature expansion  
- Train Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression models  
- Evaluate models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score  
- Compare performance across different polynomial degrees (1, 2, 3)  

## How to Run

### Option 1: Run in Google Colab
1. Upload the notebook to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  
2. Run the cells step by step  

### Option 2: Run Locally
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/polynomial-regression-sklearn.git
cd polynomial-regression-sklearn
pip install -r requirements.txt
